## What is NLP?

- Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field in Artificial Intelligence (Al) devoted to creating computers that use natural language as input and/or output.

## Components of NLP

## Natural Language Understanding

- Mapping the given input in the natural language into a useful 一 representation.
- Different level of analysis required:

```
morphologicalanalysis, syntactic analysis, semantic analysis, discourse analysis, ...
```

## Natural Language Generation

- Producing output in the natural language from some internal representation.
- Different level of synthesis required:
- NL Understanding is much harder than NL Generation. But, still both of them are hard.

```
deep planning (what to say), syntactic generation
```

## Level Of Linguistic Knowledge

## Why NLP?

- To interact with computing devices using human (natural) languages. For example,
- Building intelligent robots (AI).
- Enabling voice-controlled operation.
- To access (large amount of) information and knowledge stored in the form of human languages quickly.

## Test for Intelligence - Turing Test

- Alan Turing (1950) proposed a test of a machine's capability to perform human-like conversation.
- A human judge engages in a natural language conversation with two other parties, one a human and the other a machine; if the judge cannot reliably tell which is which, then the machine is said to pass the test.

## Early Conversational Programs

- ELIZA (by Joseph Weizenbaum), 1966
- A psychotherapist
- No real understanding; simple pattern-matching to respond to user input -&gt; canned responses

```
g (noA ssaidap xi inos saop Aym) (aw sassaidap xi Au) (x H! Aes noA op Aym) (x !l) 乙 (x plnoo noA) (x pinoo 1) (because ?x) (that is a good reason) 3 (?x) (tell me more) 0
```

## Modern NLP: NLP in the Days of Big Data

## Three trends:

1. An enormous amount of information is now available in machine readable form as natural language text (newspapers, web pages, medical records, financial filings, product reviews, discussion forums, etc.)
2. Conversational agents are becoming an important form of human-computer communication
3. Much of human-human interaction is now mediated by computers via social media

## NLP Applications

- Three prominent application areas:
- &gt; Text analytics/mining (from “unstructured data")
- Sentiment analysis
- Topic identification
- Digital Humanities ("new ways of doing scholarship that involve collaborative, transdisciplinary, and computationally engaged research, teaching, and publishing.")
- &gt; Conversational agents
- Siri, Cortana, Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant
- Chatbots
- &gt; Machine translation

## Text Analytics

- Data-mining of weblogs, microblogs, discussion forums, user reviews, and other forms of user-generated media.

## Text Analytics (cont.)

- Typically this involves the extraction of limited kinds of semantic and pragmatic information from texts
- Entity mentions
- Concept identification
- Sentiment

## Conversational Agents

## Combine

- 一
- Question answering
- From the web and from structured information sources (freebase, dbpedia, yago, etc.)
- Simple agent-like abilities
- ·Create/edit calendar entries
- ·Reminders
- Directions ?

## Question Answering

- Traditional information retrieval provides documents/resources that provide users with what they need to satisfy their information needs.
- Question answering on the other hand directly provides an answer to information needs posed as questions.

## Machine Translation (MT)

- The automatic translation of texts between languages is one of the oldest non-numerical applications in Computer Science.
- In the past 15 years or so, MT has gone from a niche academic curiosity to a robust commercial industry.

## NLP Application

## · Supervised:

- Spam Detection
- Sentiment Analysis
- Intent Classification
- Multi-Label, Multi-Class Text Classification

## · Unsupervised:

- Topic Modeling
- Keyword Extraction
- Trend/Outlier detection

## Text Mining Applications -Supervised

- -Many modeling classification typical predictive or applications can be enhanced by i incorporating g textual data in addition to traditional input variables.
- churning propensity models that include customer center notes, website forms, e-mails, and Twitter messages
- hospital admission prediction  1 models incorporating medical records notes as a new source of information
- insurance fraud modeling using adjustor notes
- sentiment categorization
- stylometry or forensic that identify applications the
